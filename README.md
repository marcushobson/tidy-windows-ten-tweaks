# tidy-windows-ten-tweaks
A collection of tweaks to Windows 10, made to tidy up the operating system, for you to pick and choose.

## What kind of tweaks are available?
Each of the tweaks falls into a distinct category.
**Disable-** usually turns off a Windows feature.
**Enable-** usually turns on a Windows feature that is not on by default.
**Prevent-** usually stop Windows from performing a particular action, in most cases these are annoyances that run automatically.
**Remove-** usually turns off a paricular UI element.

## How do I use this?
Simply download, unzip and double click any of the .reg files to apply changes to your operating system immediately. All .reg files are named logically.

## What operating systems are these tweaks for?
Windows 10. Some might work on earlier versions, such as 8, but many will be redundant for earlier iterations of Windows.

## What's in the pipeline?
Tweaks that require user input. Some of these are ready, I just need to find the time to present them nicely.

## Can I contribute?
Feel free, that's why it's public!
